Supt
====

Supt is simple interrupt notifier for World of Warcraft. It does **not** announce interrupts to other people because that is (usually) irrelevant; instead it displays a message on your screen when you successfully interrupt a spell. This helps you keep track of when you're actually interrupting things but doesn't spam everyone else when they probably don't care.
